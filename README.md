# Sign Up Form Project

## A practical demonstration of HTML forms and CSS styling

This project makes use of HTML forms and CSS to create a basic sign up form. I also wrote some JavaScript to implement

This project still has some issues with visual overlap when the window is resized. I may come back and address these issues in the future, although for now
it is not a priority.
